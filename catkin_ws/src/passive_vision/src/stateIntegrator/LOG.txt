Done
0. SpeedUP change detection 
0. Precompute background subtraction once
0. PreLoad Object Model in MetaData
0. Sort image data
0. PointCould data: 
    1. center it 
    2. align PCA 
    2. denoise
0. Test estimatePoseICP make sure it won't flip thing upside down
0. move  ACRUnit.objectList  ACRUnit.numodobject to cameraData.
0. Object on top of each other
    eachobject add visibility label: max(visable part in each view)
    if occluded not update Local 
0. Check occlusion check

0. Why so many local updates: 
    it will try to update when object reappear after occluded (good)
    find other failure cases
0. Read tote YAML file 
0. Add sift flow
0. Object without depth->>> for add
